# IBEX Imaging Large Files

This is the data store for large files and images which are used in the IBEX imaging knowledge-base.

Files are stored using [git](https://git-scm.com/), not [git-lfs](https://git-lfs.com/). This allows us to directly link to the files. As we use this primarily as an image store, add data only if it is really needed and will change very rarely or not at all.

Directory structure follows that of the IBEX knowledge-base, so that one can easily combine the data from this repository into that one.
